This site has been a running joke inside the Kampfschulte family for several years, and unfortunately it took the untimely demise of our father, Stephen Kampfschulte, to bring it to fruition.

As you may well know, Stephen had a particular temperment. A very generous, kind, and inspiring man in the classroom was often abutted with more mercurial idiosyncracies; he would absolutely fly off the handle at the slightest provocation of technology, far-right ideology, misrepresentation of facts pertaining to the function of government & history, and Nicholas Kampfschulte revving an engine outside his window. Also, any recording or cover of the Animals' 1964 hit *House of the Rising Sun.*

While sometimes jarring, and always loud. We found these outbursts endearing to the man and his character. How this generally calm, humourus, intellgent, and gentle human could so spontaneously flip his lid was a sight to see, so we (his children) took it upon ourselves to record these outbursts for posterity.

Here you'll hear Stephen Kampfschulte with no filter, in all his bombastic glory, espousing his wisdom at top-volume on topics ranging from:

  * Microsoft
  * Gmail Dual-Authentication
  * Ice-Makers
  * The Joe Biden vs. Paul Ryan 2012 Vice Presidential Debate
  * And *many, many* more

We ask that you not duplicate these recording in any way, and simply enjoy them as they are; hosted on this website. Our father was very stringent about his privacy, and we ask that you honor his wishes. *We could barely get him agree to the conceppt of this website when he was alive.*
