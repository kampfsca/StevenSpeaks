Where to start....


> Age 61 passed away Thursday, May 25, 2023 peacefully in the presence of family and friends. Steve was born June 6, 1961 in Grand Rapids to Carole (O'Dell) and Thomas Kampfschulte, he was the eldest of four children. He attended West Catholic High School and Aquinas College, where he later returned as an adjunct instructor. He was a devoted educator of 39 years for which he was honored as Kent County's High School Teacher of the year in 2009. In 2022 he retired from Lowell High School after 36 years of service; including heading the Social Studies Department, founding the storied Model U.N. and A.P. Government programs, leading World War II study trips abroad and coaching football. He was a beloved teacher who taught many, inspired countless and rivaled few. He was a captivating lecturer in both his professional and personal life. A proud man of German heritage and longtime resident of the West Side, he enjoyed wading in the pool, listening to polka and hosting memorable parties with his wife Brenda (Muczynski), a sturdy woman of good stock. He was an eccentric, engaging father of Caroline (fiancee Kyle Geary), Andrew (fiancee Grad. School), Nicholas (fiancee Anna DeBraber). He was an effusive, immensely proud grandfather to Eloise Kampfschulte giving her lessons in reading, history and government while bonding over episodes of Frasier. He was a brother to Tommy (Lisa), Anne (Rob), Greg (Darcy). His laughter, wit and volume will be sorely missed. We are truly blessed and thankful for the outpouring of stories, pictures and support from Steve's many friends, colleagues and students. He leaves behind an inspiring community.
